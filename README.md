## Description

In my journey learning HTML and CSS, I've acquired fundamental skills that form the backbone of web development. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) serves as the structure of web pages, allowing me to create content, define elements, and organize information through tags and attributes. Understanding HTML has empowered me to craft engaging and semantically structured web content.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) has been instrumental in enhancing the visual presentation of web pages. By learning CSS, I've gained the ability to style HTML elements, manipulate layouts, and apply design aesthetics using properties like colors, fonts, layouts. This has allowed me to create visually appealing and responsive web designs across various devices.
